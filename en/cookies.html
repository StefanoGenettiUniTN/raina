    <p>This website uses technical cookies to ensure the proper functioning of procedures and improve the user experience of online applications. This document provides information about the use of cookies and similar technologies, how they are used on the site, and how to manage them.</p>

    <h4>Definitions</h4>

    <p>Cookies are small text files that websites visited by users send to their devices, where they are stored to be retransmitted to the same sites on subsequent visits. Third-party cookies are instead set by a website different from the one the user is visiting. This happens because each site may include elements (images, maps, sounds, specific links to web pages from other domains, etc.) hosted on servers different from that of the visited site.</p>

    <h4>Types of Cookies</h4>

    <p>Based on their characteristics and use, cookies can be divided into several categories:</p>

    <p>- Technical Cookies. Technical cookies are those used solely to "carry out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide that service" (see art. 122, paragraph 1, of the Code). They are not used for further purposes and are normally installed directly by the owner or manager of the website. They can be subdivided into navigation or session cookies, which guarantee normal browsing and use of the website; analytics cookies, assimilated to technical cookies when used directly by the site manager to collect aggregated information on the number of users and how they visit the site; functionality cookies, which allow the user to browse based on selected criteria to improve the service provided. Prior consent of users is not required for the installation of such cookies, while the obligation to provide information pursuant to art. 13 of the Code remains, which the site manager, if only these devices are used, may provide in the manner deemed most appropriate.</p>

    <p>- Profiling Cookies. Profiling cookies are aimed at creating user profiles and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user during web browsing. Due to the particular invasiveness these devices may have in the private sphere of users, European and Italian regulations require that the user be adequately informed about their use and give valid consent. This refers to art. 122 of the Code, which provides that "the storage of information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user or the access to information already stored is permitted only on condition that the subscriber or user has given their consent after being informed in the simplified manner referred to in article 13, paragraph 3" (art. 122, paragraph 1, of the Code). This website does not use profiling cookies.</p>

    <h4>Third-Party Cookies</h4>

    <p>By visiting this website, you may receive cookies from sites managed by other organizations ("third parties"). An example is the presence of "social plugins" for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or LinkedIn, or embedded multimedia content systems such as YouTube, Flickr. These are parts generated directly by the said sites and integrated into the web page of the hosting site visited. The presence of these plugins causes the transmission of cookies to and from all sites managed by third parties. The management of information collected by third parties is governed by their respective privacy policies, to which reference should be made. For greater transparency and convenience, the following are the web addresses of the various policies and ways to manage cookies.</p>

    <h4>Analytics Cookies</h4>

    <h4>WebTrends</h4>

    <p>To monitor and improve site performance, a market product for statistical analysis is used to track site accesses. It may use cookies, permanent or not, to collect statistical information and "unique visitors" of the site. The cookies, defined as "Unique Visitor Cookies," contain an alphanumeric code identifying browsing computers, without collecting any personal data.</p>

    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>

    <p>The site also includes components provided by Google Analytics, a web traffic analysis service offered by Google, Inc. ("Google"). These cookies are used solely to monitor and improve site performance. For more information, please refer to the following link:</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.google.it/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.it/policies/privacy/partners/</a></p>

    <p>The user can selectively disable Google Analytics by installing the opt-out component provided by Google on their browser. To disable Google Analytics, please refer to the following link:</p>

    <p><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>

    <h4>Google Maps (Google)</h4>

    <p>We use interactive Google Maps because we believe they provide a useful way for visitors to reach us. We integrate Google Maps tools on the basis that Google respects its privacy policy and terms of service. Google Maps may install cookies called:
    "NID" lasting six months and
    "PREF" lasting two years.</p>

    <h4>Google Fonts (Google)</h4>

    <p>To display some fonts on this site, we use Google Fonts by Google Inc., which allows integration of these contents. Information from cookies installed by Google Fonts will be transmitted by the user's browser to Google, which may use the data collected to contextualize or personalize ads on its advertising network. For more information, we invite the user to visit the relevant page on Google Inc.'s website.</p>

    <h4>Duration of Cookies</h4>

    <p>Some cookies (session cookies) remain active only until the browser is closed or the logout command is executed. Other cookies "survive" browser closure and are available in subsequent visits by the user. These cookies are called persistent, and their duration is set by the server at the time of creation. In some cases, an expiration is set; in other cases, the duration is unlimited.</p>

    <h4>Managing Cookies</h4>

    <p>The user can decide whether to accept cookies by using their browser settings. <br>
    Attention: disabling technical cookies totally or partially may compromise optimal use of the site. <br>
    Disabling third-party cookies does not affect navigation. <br>
    Settings can be defined specifically for different sites and web applications. Browsers also allow setting different rules for "own" cookies and third-party cookies. For example, in Firefox, through the Tools->Options->Privacy menu, it is possible to access a control panel to decide whether to accept different types of cookies and proceed to their removal. Documentation on how to set cookie management rules for your browser is easily available online; here are some links related to the main browsers:<br><br>
